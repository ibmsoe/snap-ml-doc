Introduction
----------------------------------

*Snap Machine Learning (Snap ML)* is a library for training generalized linear models. It is being developped at the IBM Research - Zürich laboratory with the vision to remove training time as a bottleneck for machine learning applications.
Snap ML supports a large number of classical machine learning models and 
scales gracefully to data sets with billions of examples and/or features.
It offers distributed training, GPU acceleration and supports sparse data structures.

    "With Snap ML you can train your machine learning model faster than you can snap your fingers!"


The *Snap ML* library offers two different packages:

**snap-ml-local**
    The local version of Snap ML is designed to run on a single machine. It targets small to medium scale data that can fit inside the memory of a single machine. *snal-ml-local* offers GPU acceleration and supports sparse data structures. The library is exposed to the user via a Python API compatible with sklearn and can seamslessly be integrated into existing Python application.

**snap-ml-distributed**
    The distributed version of Snap ML offers distributed training of models across a cluster of machines. This enables training on large scale datasets that exceed the memory capacity of a single machine. For *snap-ml-distributed* a pySpark and an MPI API are available.
